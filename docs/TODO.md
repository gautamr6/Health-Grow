# To Do
Features to implement
* Travis, codecov integration for PR
* Sessions for users
* Make modal for crud stuff
* d3 smooth transitions when data react state changes
* Abstract out admin CRUD (like Django admin automatically create CRUD for models)

Known Bugs
* Unable to add workout with same workout name (gautam fix?)
* Filter search bar resets window location
* Achievements: allow for no model selection (not required), have fixed selections for field
* Add image to workout on react side (base 64 encoding/decoding)
* Keep timestamps: createdAt and updatedAt

Kevin
* Add user field for workouts/journals (in android it should be automatic)
* different dashboard whether admin/user logged in
* Logout buttons
* edit achievement logic has to be dynamic on the mobile end (gautam logic)
* Let android use react routes instead of express
* Delete user also delete associated workouts/journals
* add redirections
